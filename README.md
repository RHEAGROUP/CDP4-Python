The CDP4-Scripts library is a .NET library for scripting language users (such as Python) that would like to have access to ECSS-E-TM-10-25A data coming from a ECSS-E-TM-10-25A Annex C data-source such as the CDP4 Web Services. The CDP4-SDK provides .NET programmers to access and manipulate ECSS-E-TM-10-25A data; the CDP4-Scripts acts as a bridge between the CDP4-SDK and gives the same capability to Python programmers. Since the CDP4-SDK is a .NET SDK the CDP4-Scripts library requires the [[pythonnet|https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet/wiki/Installation]] library to be installed. The CDP4-Scripts library is provided to the community under the [GNU LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).
